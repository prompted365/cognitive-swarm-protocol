## üß† Real-Time WebSocket Integration

This cognitive UI system supports **live updates** from a backend orchestration engine via a WebSocket stream. These updates reflect real-time status, performance, and coordination metrics across all visualized swarm components.

### üîå Connection Overview

The system establishes a live connection using the following WebSocket endpoint:

```
wss://api.lovable.dev/cognitive-stream
```

### üîÑ WebSocket Lifecycle

On component mount, the system initiates and manages the socket lifecycle:

```ts
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.lovable.dev/cognitive-stream');
```

#### ‚úÖ On Open:

* Sets `isConnected = true`
* Transitions `mcpStatus` to `"running"`
* Logs successful connection for Claude Code Hook simulation

#### üîÅ On Message:

* Parses incoming JSON payloads
* Delegates handling to `handleRealTimeUpdate(data)`

  * This drives live metrics, updates component state, and appends user-facing streaming logs

#### ‚ùå On Close:

* Sets `isConnected = false`
* Transitions `mcpStatus` to `"disconnected"`
* Optionally attempts reconnection (add logic if desired)

## üì° Expected WebSocket Payloads

The backend should emit messages in this format:

```json
{
  "componentId": "CSA1",
  "type": "performance_update",         // or "status_change"
  "performance": 97,
  "message": "VISION_PROCESSOR optimization cycle complete",
  "updates": {
    "efficiency": 94,
    "throughput": 1250,
    "errorRate": 0.02
  }
}
```

Payloads may also include:

* `type: "status_change"` ‚Äì updates the component's status (`active`, `idle`, `optimizing`)
* `type: "cognitive_analysis"` ‚Äì feeds insights into the global `realTimeData` store
* `type: "token_update"` ‚Äì tracks token usage for streaming Claude output

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Source (Simulated or Real)

This WebSocket feed is powered by one of two options:

### üîÅ Simulated Mode (Dev Default)

In development, real-time updates are faked using a local interval:

```ts
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  const mockUpdate = { ... };
  handleRealTimeUpdate(mockUpdate);
}, 3000);
```

### üöÄ Live Mode (Claude + MCP Runtime)

In production, connect to the actual backend emitting live swarm state via:

* A real Claude orchestration engine using Claude Code Hooks
* A backend MCP orchestration server (e.g., LangGraph, Express + SSE, or Claude SPARC runtime)

---

## üß™ Dev Tips

* To test WebSocket disconnection states, disconnect from internet or change the `wss://` endpoint.
* You can modify the `simulateToolCall()` function to return mock diagnostics.
* Toggle the `isAnimating` or `mcpStatus` states manually for visual debugging.

---

## üîê Security Note

Ensure WebSocket traffic is secured:

* Use `wss://` (secure socket layer)
* Validate payloads against a schema
* Consider auth token headers or signed connections for Claude production use
